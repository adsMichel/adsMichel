**`Digital Craftsman (Adventurer/Creator/Developer)`**

I'm an adventurer, newbie full-stack developer, and content creator, showing my version of the natural world through my job. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code. All tips are constructed in a similar way, from ideation and planning to finalizing the content with personal touches. I publish this content on my Blog michelchimbinha.com
